1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until smooth. Stir in the molasses and eggs.
Combine 1 1/2 cups of the flour, baking soda, salt, allspice, cloves, cinnamon, and ginger; beat into the
molasses mixture. Gradually stir in the remaining flour by hand to form a stiff dough. Divide dough into 2
pieces.
3. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes. Place pieces 1
inch apart onto parchment-lined cookie sheets. Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the
preheated oven. Cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

electric mixer on high speed, beat for about 5 minutes, or until mixture is thick and stiff. Keep covered with a
moist cloth and plastic wrap until ready to decorate.
