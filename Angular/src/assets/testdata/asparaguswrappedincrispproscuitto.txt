INGREDIENTS:
1 tablespoon olive oil
16 spears fresh asparagus, trimmed
16 slices prosciutto

DIRECTIONS:
1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking
sheet with aluminum foil, and coat with olive oil.

2. Blanch asparagus to preserve color. (Submerse in boiling water for
2 minutes, then plunge in ice bath.)

3.Wrap one slice of prosciutto around each asparagus spear, starting
at the bottom, and spiraling up to the tip. Place the wrapped spears
on the prepared baking sheet.

4.Bake for 5 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove, and shake the
pan back and forth to roll the spears over. Return to the oven for
another 5 minutes, or until asparagus is tender, and prosciutto is
crisp. Serve immediately.
