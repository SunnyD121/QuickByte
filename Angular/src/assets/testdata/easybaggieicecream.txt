These are a lot of fun and super easy ice cream recipes kids can have fun putting together. The
technique is different then the rolling a can method only because you are squeezing the bag and
tossing it around but the science behind it is still the same. You might want to get your winter
gloves (oven mitts?) out for this activity- it gets cold!

Individual Baggie Vanilla Ice cream recipes

1/2 cup half and half, milk or cream
1 tablespoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla
1 sandwich size ziploc baggie
1 gallon size ziploc baggie
3 cups crushed ice
1/2 cup rock salt
Add cream, sugar and vanilla into small baggie and zip closed. In larger baggie add ice and rock
salt. Place smaller ice cream filled bag inside larger rock salt baggie. Seal bag closed. Double
check to make sure both are sealed tight. Squeeze, toss, wiggle, play catch with the bag until
mixture thickens about 10-15 minutes. Eat with a spoon.
For a Chocolate baggie ice cream recipe add ¼ teaspoon cocoa powder or 1 tablespoon
chocolate drink mix powder.

Yogurt Ice Cream in a bag

2 containers plain or vanilla yogurt
1 cup mashed fruit, strawberries or peaches work great
Add ingredients in a Ziploc bag and squeeze together to combine. Freeze several hours. (Or use
the method above) When ready to eat snip a corner off a bag and squeeze out or eat with a
spoon.

Science behind homemade ice cream:
The salt lowers the freezing point of the ice. Meaning your ice cream freezes gradually. The
mixture of the salt and ice helps freeze your ice cream quickly. (But it will still take 10-20 minutes
to be ready.)
