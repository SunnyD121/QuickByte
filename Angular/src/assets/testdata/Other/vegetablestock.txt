Making vegetable stock is quick compared with making stock from poultry or beef bones, but it's no less flavorful. 
Vegetable stock only needs to simmer for 30 to 45 minutes to extract the maximum flavor from vegetables. In fact, quality can 
actually start to diminish beyond a certain point if the vegetables are simmered for too long.
Prep Time: 15 minutes
Cook Time: 45 minutes
Ingredients:
1 gallon cold water
1 medium onion, peeled and chopped
1 medium leek (white and green parts), rinsed and chopped
1 medium rib celery, chopped
1 medium carrot, peeled and chopped
1/2 medium turnip, chopped
1/2 small tomato, chopped
3 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
2 Tbsp vegetable oil
-------- For Sachet: --------
1 bay leaf
1/2 tsp dried thyme
3-4 fresh parsley stems
3-4 whole black peppercorns
1 whole clove
Preparation:
1. Make a sachet by tying the thyme, peppercorns, clove, parsley stems and bay leaf into a
piece of cheesecloth.
2. In a heavy-bottomed stock pot or soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat.
3. Lower the heat; add all the vegetables and sweat, with the lid on, for about 5 minutes or
until the onions are softened and slightly translucent. Don't brown the vegetables,
though.

minutes.
5. Strain, cool and refrigerate.
