Ingredients:
Crust
1/3 cup butter
1/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 cup flour

Filling
8 oz cream cheese
1/4 cup sugar
2 T milk
1 T lemon juice
1/2 t vanilla
1 egg
1/2 cup jam, any flavor

Directions:
To prepare the crust: preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Place the butter and brown sugar in a bowl and mix with an electric mixer on low
speed for 1 minute, or until fluffy. Add the flour and mix for 1 minute, or until
combined. Press the dough into the bottom of an ungreased 8-inch square pan
and bake for 10 minutes, or until lightly browned.

To prepare the filling: Place the cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl and mix
with an electric mixer on low speed for 2 minutes or until smooth. Add the milk,
lemon juice, vanilla, and egg, and mix for 1 minute or until thoroughly combined.

Spread the mixture over the baked crust and drop tablespoons of the jam on the
filling. Run a knife back and forth through the filling to distribute the jam, being
careful not to cut into the crust. Bake for 25 minutes, or until lightly browned.
Cool completely and cut into 2-inch squares.
